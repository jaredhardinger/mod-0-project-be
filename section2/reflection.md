## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
*  Those with a growth mindset actively seek out challenge. Also, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
*  I am cognizant of my mistakes (which are not infrequent) and am always learning from them. However, I don't always intentionally reflect on what's been worked on, especially things that I did not have issues with.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
*  A conditional statement is used to perform a certain set of instructions when certain conditions are met. Three examples: if, if/else, if/elsif/else

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
*  Use an if-statement if you want something to happen when something else is true or false
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if (condition)
    do this
  end           
```
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
*  Join conditions with `||` (or) or `&&` (and)
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```Ruby
if number == 3
    puts "The number is '3'"
elsif number == 2
    puts "The number is '2'"
else
    puts "The number is neither '2' nor '3'"
end
```
