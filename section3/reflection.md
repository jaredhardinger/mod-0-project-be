## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
*  I feel as if I had already been using a version of this technique: I fill up a glass of water/cup of tea/etc and work until I finish off that drink. When it's finished, I get up to take a quick break and get a refill. Focusing is important, but so is hydration!
2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
*  Setting intentions helped when I made the goal something I could accomplish in 30 mins to an hour. Any longer and there are too many tasks and it's easier to get overwhelmed and notice time dragging on. Less than 30 mins and I don't feel productive enough. Pomodoro definitely helps my mind focus more than having simple list of things to do with no clear timeframe to complete. I need to try it for getting my house projects accomplished in a more timely manner!
3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
*  A hash matches some items (keys) with other items (values). This differs from an array in that the order doesn't matter, it's simply a 'look-up table'
4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```ruby
pet_store = {cat_food: 27, cat_toys: 526, cats: 2}
```
5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
```ruby
states[:IA]
```
6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
```ruby
states.keys
states.values
```
7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
*  A dictionary. If I want to look up the definition of 'erudite' I don't want to have to know the index; I want to be able to input the work and receive the definition in return.
8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
*  There's so much that I don't know that I don't know--I'm sure questions will come, but there are none at this moment [that google hasn't already answered]
